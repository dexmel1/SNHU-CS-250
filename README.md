Intro to SDLC with Agile

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
- I walk through what the user is asking. If they're requesting a large, complicated process, then I break it down step by step. I ensure I understand as much as possible about the process and how to effectively break it down into user stories and tasks. This makes it easier for developers to build the pieces that will eventually create the whole, as opposed to trying to do everything at once and getting lost along the way.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- I use a hybrid approach. I attempt to lay out everything that needs to be done and gather as much information as possible in the beginning. But once the development starts, I remain flexible and react to new priorities or tasks from the customer as needed.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
- Communication, collaboration, and work ethic will take a team far. Being able to know what is going on throughout the entire team, being willing to work together and help each other, and having the drive to meet deadlines are critical to a successful team.
